Nanobot Swarm Control
---
**OVERVIEW:**

This project simulates the control of various nanobot types using AI models like neural networks and particle filters. It supports both simulated and real-world data for positioning and sensors, demonstrating applications in fields like medical treatments and brain-computer interfaces (BCI). The simulation visualizes nanobot movements in 3D and includes models for Magnetic, Light-activated, Acoustic, Chemical, and DNA-based nanobots.

**FEATURES:**

Nanobot Types: Magnetic, Light-activated, Acoustic, Chemical, DNA-based.

Centralized Control: Uses deep learning and hybrid strategies for decision-making.

Real-time Tracking: 3D visualization of nanobot positions.

Applications: Computational Neuroscience, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Cognitive Enhancement.



**INSTALLATION:**

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/Proxysaints/Nanobot_swarm_control.git
cd Nanobot_swarm_control
3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the simulation:
